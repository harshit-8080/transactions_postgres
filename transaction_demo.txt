exports.transactions_demo = async(req,res)=>{
	
	const t = await sequelize.transaction();

	try{
		const user = await db.user.create(userObject,{transaction:t});

		const data = await db.user.findAll({
			where:{
				id:100;
			}
		},{
			transaction:t
		});

		await t.commit();
		
	}
	catch(error){
		await t.rollback();
	}	

}



Points to remember :-
	1. sequelize dont do use transaction bydefault.

	2.	BUt we should use transaction for productions

	3.	Two Types of transactions in sequelize
			1.  unmanaged transaction  --> Above example is unmanaged  transaction as here we are doing manually

			2. 	managed transaction --> Managed transactions handle committing or rolling back the transaction automatically. 
										You start a managed transaction by passing a callback to sequelize.transaction.
